calander for filteration
date wise filter for transactions and monthly visits

flow

create a group > add tenant in a group (i.e i supposidly own a pg and have 10 rooms i will put those 10 rooms in a group and will add 10 tenants in it).

in a few cases the electricity bill might not be applicable or electricity bill is not generate select electricity bill not applicable for those scenarios

the phonto of the tenant is optional
so does aadhaar card number, aadhaar card front photo and card's back side photo
(if one of the aadhaar card's field is mentioed then all the details should be filled to maintain consistancy)

making sure that an image should not exceed the threshold of 700kb per image.

now visits are supposed to be monthly and monthly rent accounts shall be created for the tenants to keep a better track

while adding the visits there is the functionality of viewing/ reviewing the past visits and transactions(rent paid by the tenant) by the tenant you're visitsing

transactions are when the tenants pays rent it could have multiple entries per tenat as tenants might give the money in instalments sometimes.

hence this cycle will be repeated everymonth to sustrain the preocess
